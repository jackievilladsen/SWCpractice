THE WAR ON MARS

by Jackie Villadsen

Mars is a planet with lots of aliens.  They probed my brain.
They come to Earth to steal our water.
The Sun tried to kill them but it failed.
So we must finish the job.

- Recorded on the last day of human history,
translated from the original Human language by Xsdksa the Martian historian
